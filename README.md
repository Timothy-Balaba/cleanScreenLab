Make a circle somewhere in the central area of the window that is 50px wide.It does not have to be a perfect circle.You can use a div with a radius setting to make it round.Give it an interesting background color.
Make the circle grow by 10px every 250ms.
Remove the circle when you click on it.
Put 3 text inputs on the screen with labels:width, growth amount, grow rate.Also add a button labeled ‘Start’.When the button is clicked the circle should appear, this time with the specified width, growth size and interval for growing.
Add another text input labeled ‘Number circles’When the button is clicked put this number of circles spread around the screen and make all of them behave according to the above specifications.
